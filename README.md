## Research Questions  
We are interested in which variables affect the starting salary for an initial job offer the most. We have developed the following questions that we will explore:

- How much does having an internship affect your starting salary
- Does it matter if the internship is related to the respective major? / Are those that get internships more likely to choose a post grad job related to their major?
- How much does one internship differ from many? 


TODO: ADD SCREENSHOTS OF GRAPHS/GOOD INFORMATION WE FIND AND WHAT WE DID WITH IT.
